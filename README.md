# StacksFlow

StacksFlow is a simple NFT mint + staking app with reward tokens on Stacks.

## How it works (for users)

1) Connect your wallet.
2) Mint an NFT (0.0001 STX per mint).
3) Stake your NFT to start earning.
4) Claim rewards anytime or unstake to claim and get your NFT back.

## How users earn rewards

- Each staked NFT earns 1 reward token per hour.
- The app uses ~6 blocks as one hour (approximate on-chain time).
- You can stake multiple NFTs and claim each one.
- Claiming resets the timer for that NFT; only full-hour intervals count.
